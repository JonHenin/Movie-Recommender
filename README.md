## MOVIE RECOMMENDATIONS

## Project Description
In this project we use data from an open sourced Netflix database which gives movie ratings per user.  Each usersâ€™ ratings are vectorized.  An interface is built to take input from a user (a list of movies and ratings).  These results are vectorized and then using cosine similarity, we compare to similar Netflix users and provide a top ten movie recommendations.


## Methods Used
* Cosine Similarity

## Technologies
